            <h2>Project Summary</h2>
            <p>
                For my final project I am going to make a video game review website. Each page will be its own article about a video game and may
                include videos of gameplay, screenshots, and links to other people who have talked about that game.
                My plan is to create five pages to begin. Each page will be about a different game. I will need to decide what games I
                want to talk about and what kind of content I want to include for each article. Some may benefit from a small amount of gameplay
                to explain the game and gain the reader's interest. Some games may be popular enough that no one will want to waste their time
                watching a video. I will want to find a unique thing to say about those games.
            </p>
            Working List of Games:
            <ul>
                <li>Animal Crossing</li>
                <li>Rimworld</li>
                <li>Don't Starve</li>
                <li>Oxenfree</li>
                <li>Night in the Woods</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The story behind this idea:
                Many people are stuck at home right now and are looking for something fun to pass the time. There are a lot of games to choose
                from and a lot of games that are popular right now require a console that may be too expensive. I want to make people
                aware of some options that are cheaper and available on a PC, but are not taxing on an older device. Most of the games
                I want to talk about are either indie games or not very well known and would be a new experience for a lot of people.
                I also want to talk about animal crossing, because it is very popular right now and a lot of what is shown about it on
                social media is really impressive and overwhelming. I want to make an article that helps people who are overwhelmed with
                trying to keep up with all the cool things they are seeing to play the game at their own pace and have fun their way.
