        <h1>Who Inspires Me?</h1>
        <p>
            We often look upon famous people throughout history and reminisce about their lives. Although no one is perfect, some lives tell a story we want to relate to. Stories of facing adversity, overcoming all odds, and, most of all, victory.
        </p>
        <h2>What makes a hero?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Selflessness - Putting your life at risk with no intent to be repaid.</li>
            <li>Dedication - Heroes don't happen by accident. They take steps every day towards their calling.</li>
            <li>Passion - Dreaming of world changed for the better and acting to make that change happen.</li>
            <li>Courage - The ability to leap into action when the moment arrives</li>
            <li>Empathy - Ability to understand and care about situations that differ from your own</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            There are many famous examples throughout history, such as Martin Luther King, Mother Teresa, Theodore Roosevelt, Alan Turing, Amelia Earhart, the list goes on.
            Each of them memorable for different reasons. The reality is, there are constantly heroes around us; the list so long that many go largely unnoticed.
