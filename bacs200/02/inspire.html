        <h1>Who Inspires Me?</h1>
        <p>
           We often look upon famous people throughout history and reminisce about their lives. Although no one is perfect, some lives tell a story we want to relate to. Stories of facing adversity, overcoming all odds, and, most of all, victory.
        </p>
        
        <h2>What makes a hero?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Selflessness - Putting your life at risk with no intent to be repaid.</li>
            <li>Dedication - Heroes don't happen by accident. They take steps every day towards their calling.</li>
            <li>Passion - Dreaming of world changed for the better and acting to make that change happen.</li>
            <li>Courage - The ability to leap into action when the moment arrives</li>
            <li>Empathy - Ability to understand situations that differ from your own</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <p>

            There are many famous examples throughout history, such as Martin Luther King, Mother Teresa, Theodore Roosevelt, Alan Turing, Amelia Earhart, the list goes on. 
            Each of them memorable for different reasons. The reality is, there are constantly heroes around us; the list so long that many go largely unnoticed.</p>

    <h3>In a couple of weeks, it will have been two years since the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida...</h3> This traumatic event caused children to have to fight for their lives, in more ways than one. Many who have survived are taking their fight nationwide to try to make sure this never happens again. This was one among many other shootings that should never have happened, and these children should not have been forced to grow up so quickly. I have never felt so inspired as I do by these kids - many of whom are now adults. It feels wrong to say I am inspired by them, because they never asked for this life. No one would ask to go through that. Yet, it gives me hope for my generation and the ones following. Perhaps we have more power to change the world that we think. </p>
