        <p>The year 2020 seems like the perfect opportunity to reflect on how society is changing and progressing. For centuries we have made reading, writing, and math the staples of education. 30 years ago, we would have still said the same thing. However, with the rise of the internet, it has become impossible to succeed without a fundamental understanding of the technology available today. Additionally, with constant innovation in technology, not keeping up now means completely falling out of the loop in the future. Ten years ago, computers in classrooms were a lot clunkier, slower, and particularly stationary. Computer labs were set up sparsely in most schools, and were reserved for specific topics. Now, most students, ranging from elementary to college age, have the ability to bring laptops and smartphones into the classroom.

            The way we teach has also changed. In addition to students learning new technology at a rapid pace, teachers must also prove they are up to date with new online class platforms, in-class smart boards, and mobile phone capabilities. This has led to a new way of thinking altogether. Institutions have a tendency to believe in the <em>way we have always done things.</em> The same was true for technology in the classrooms. At the beginning, many schools and instructors struggled to catch up to new standards, because they had not been convinced of the value. After all, most of history has not had the internet and the networking structure it provides. Today, there is a much stronger emphasis on keeping everyone up to date with technological progress, because it is becoming more common knowledge that the world is gaining and sharing information at exponential rates. The need to be connected to the rest of the world and experience the innovations it has to offer can no longer be ignored. We have entered a new era of information, connectivity, and educational standard.
